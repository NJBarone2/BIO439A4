# Write a script that, when run using the command line, outputs the linguistic complexity of each sequence in a file of sequences. The file should be specified by the end user as a command line argument. The linguistic complexity of a sequence is defined as the proportion of kmers that are observed compared to the total number that are theoretically possible.
# Create a Seq object that accepts a DNA sequence (a string). 
# Add a method to count kmers of size k, where k is specified as a argument.
# Add a method to create a pandas data frame containing all possible k and the associated number of observed and expected kmers (see above table).
# Add a method to produce a graph from the data frame of the proportion of each kmer observed.
# Add a method to calculate linguistic complexity.
# Write a script to thoroughly test each of your functions.
# Use the main function to read in your sequence data and output results.
# Create a github repository including a README (in markdown) to submit your work.

# There is a Readme.md file which gives an overview of what is in this directory
# This is the Readme.md file, then there is a file, "" that contains the main script as well as all the data and results from the script
